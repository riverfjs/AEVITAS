# Skills

Current skill set for `aevitas`. Each skill directory includes:

- `SKILL.md`: behavior contract and usage rules
- `scripts/`: executable implementation
- optional `bin/`, `data/`, `config.json`

## Installed Skills

### `flight-search`

Fetches flight data from ly.com in three modes:

- `outbound_day`
- `return_after_outbound`
- `roundtrip_locked`

Entry:

```bash
node ~/.aevitas/workspace/.claude/skills/flight-search/scripts/search.cjs <mode> ...
```

Source of truth:

- `view.table` is the display-ready block
- `flights[*].price` uses `{ amount, text }`

### `flight-monitor`

`flight-search` owns data fetch/format.

```bash
bash ~/.aevitas/workspace/.claude/skills/flight-monitor/scripts/monitor.sh list
node ~/.aevitas/workspace/.claude/skills/flight-monitor/scripts/check.cjs
bash ~/.aevitas/workspace/.claude/skills/flight-monitor/scripts/monitor.sh delete <id>
```

Modes:

- `roundtrip_locked`
- `outbound_day`

## Development Notes

- Keep SKILL.md in English.
- Keep one-file-one-responsibility in `scripts/`.
- Prefer absolute workspace paths with `~/.aevitas/workspace/.claude/skills/...`.
- For behavior details, always read each skill's `SKILL.md`.
